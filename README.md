# The Pig Game

The Pig Game is an online game implemented as an express app. This game focuses on the manipulation of the DOM using JavaScript. The HTML and CSS of the page (/game) were created by Jonas Schmedtmann for his Udemy course - The Complete JavaScript Course 2018. The underlying JavaScript performing the logic of the game, and the HTML and CSS of the landing page (/) were implemented by me.

## Game Rules
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
* In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
* BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
